## Hero Banner Image

To complete the visual appeal of your repository, create a hero banner image with the following specifications:

### Recommended Image Specifications:

- **Dimensions**: 1200x400 pixels (3:1 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **File size**: Under 500KB for fast loading

### Design Elements to Include:
1. **Visual Theme**: Dark/tech aesthetic with AI/neural network motifs
2. **Color Scheme**: Blue (#412991 - OpenAI brand), white text, subtle gradients
3. **Content Elements**:
   - Repository title: "Agentic AI Program"
   - Subtitle: "Advanced Multi-Agent Systems Engineering"
   - Visual elements: Connected nodes, workflow diagrams, or agent icons
   - Technology logos: Python, OpenAI (if licensing allows)

### Tools for Creation:
- **Canva**: Pre-made tech templates
- **Figma**: Professional design capabilities

### Alternative Options:
If you don't create a custom banner, the README will still look professional with just the text and badges. You can remove the `<img>` tag from the README.md if needed.

Once you have your hero banner image, save it as `assets/hero-banner.png` and it will automatically display in the README.
